Emotional issues such as self-harm, anorexia, and violent tendencies may not fit neatly into any one category, but all of them stem from its perverse addictive 
nature they impose on their victims. For example, self-harm and violence happen because one is so overcome by anger that they can only quell its flames with 
physically and emotionally destructive actions. Anorexia is similar in this, where a never-ending cycle of chasing the dopamine of a “perfect body” results in one 
being woefully depressed and undernourished. With this step-by-step guide, you will be on your way to kicking these issues out of your life!

(1)ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!! It does not matter how you develop this mentality, just do it as fast as possible, even if you have to yell it out 
   50 times while doing a handstand.

(2)Before you do anything else, make sure you have coping mechanisms to prevent you from harming yourself or others. They can be anything, ranging from screaming in privacy, or ripping
up paper by hand. However, as your recovery continues, be sure to redirect your emotions towards something healthy and productive, such as light exercise, reading, 
or meditation.

(3)Start up slowly, replacing your harmful thoughts with better, more productive ones. Do a little everyday, and make sure to utilize healthy emotional releases, 
like the ones stated above. Like other addictions, it’ll never truly go away, but with these tips, you will live a life with more freedom.

(4)Finally, have fun! Life is too short to worry about past traumas and issues, and a little happiness will go a long way.

Be sure to live a prosperous existence!
