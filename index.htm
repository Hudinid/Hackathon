                        DISCLAIMER!!! This website is not a substitute for any type of professional help. 
                        The information should simply serve as a supplement to an already established treatment plan.</p>
<p style="color:white;"><p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:white; font-size: 17px;">
  Life can burden one with many problems, not the least being an addiction of some kind. They can come in many forms, 
  but all of them can devastate one’s entire livelihood if not promptly dealt with. Generally, addictions can be classified 
  into three categories: Substance, Technology, and Emotional. Please select what type of addiction you're trying to deal with.
  Dealing with addiction is never easy, but I hope our information will help you or a loved one pave their way to recovery!

<p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:white; font-size: 17px;">
Emotional issues such as self-harm, anorexia, and violent tendencies may not fit neatly into any one category, but all of them stem from its perverse addictive nature they impose on
their victims. For example, self-harm and violence happen because one is so overcome by anger that they can only quell its flames with physically and emotionally destructive actions.
Anorexia is similar in this, where a never-ending cycle of chasing the dopamine of a “perfect body” results in one being woefully depressed and undernourished. With this step-by-step
guide, you will be on your way to kicking these issues out of your life!
<br>
<br>
(1)ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!! It does not matter how you develop this mentality, just do it as fast as possible, even if you have to yell it out 50
   times while doing a handstand.
<br>
<br>
(2)Before you do anything else, make sure you have coping mechanisms to prevent you from harming yourself or others. They can be anything, ranging from screaming in privacy, or ripping
up paper by hand. However, as your recovery continues, be sure to redirect your emotions towards 
something healthy and productive, such as light exercise, reading, or meditation.
<br>
<br>
(3)Start up slowly, replacing your harmful thoughts with better, more productive ones. Do a little everyday, and make sure to utilize healthy emotional releases, like the ones stated above. Like 
Other addictions, it’ll never truly go away, but with these tips, you will live a life with more freedom.
<br>
<br>
(4)Finally, have fun! Life is too short to worry about past traumas and issues, and a little happiness
     will go a long way.
<br>
<br>
Be sure to live a prosperous existence!
<br>
<br>
If you feel suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-8255 ).

While addictions related to technology are overshadowed by issues of substance abuse, its effects prove to be just as devastating, if not more so.
Extreme technological addiction shares many similarities with its substance counterparts, including lying to your loved ones of your usage, problems at work,
school, or home, and needing more and more gaming to relieve your stress. As technology is an essential part of our lives, quitting cold turkey may not be plausible, 
but there are ways to take control of your usage. With this step-by-step program, you may look forward to a healthier, freer, and happier lifestyle.
<br>
<br>
(1) ADMIT TO YOURSELF THÅT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!! While your peers may not see technological addiction as dangerous as substance abuse, these addictions are still 
difficult to handle.
<br>
<br> 
(2) Technological addictions are a double edged sword. While technology’s importance in daily life may lead to more opportunities to relapse, it also saves you the 
hassle of quitting cold turkey, allowing you to ease into a reasonable time period of use. 
<br>
<br>
(3) Start off slowly, reducing your technology time by small increments each day. Keep a timer to know when your time is up, so you don’t fall into your old habits 
and overindulge. One should also seek alternative, healthy habits, like exercise, meditation, and reading. 
<br>
<br>
(4)While professional help may not be necessary, it can certainly help. Benefits include therapy, counseling, and a plethora of empathetic and understanding minds 
to talk to. You may also benefit from Cognitive Behavior Therapy(CBT), which helps you declutter your mind and have more productive thoughts.
<br>
<br>
I hope you live a more bright and fulfilling life!

Drug addiction is the most well known form, and its stigma can be cruel to those who suffer under this condition. What makes it especially complicated is that it not only affects one mentally, but 
physiologically. However, drug addiction can happen to people of all walks of life, and anyone is capable of kicking it to the curb. With this step-by-step process, you will be on your way to a healthier,
drug-free life!
<br>
<br>
<br>
(1)ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!! Yell it at your wall, the streets, write it on a piece of paper, even type it in a word document and print it out, whatever it takes for
    you to ingrain this concept into your brain.

<br>
<br>
(2)While addiction will never truly go away, the first 3 days of withdrawal are the hardest, and will become easier as you become stronger and better! This is a tough task for even the best of people, so do 
    not despair if you feel yourself succumbing to temptation. Whatever happens, the one thing you should never do is to give up!

<br>
<br>
(3)As your substance is no longer there to deal with stress, you may find yourself justifying the drug and its pull on your body. DO NOT GIVE IN! In the case of nicotine, nicotine gum and patches are a good
    way to ease into quitting cold turkey. It will also benefit you if you channel your stress into different, more productive habits, such as exercise, drawing, and meditation.

<br>
<br>
(4)If you are able, seek professional help. They can provide you with therepy, medications to wean your cravings, and a compassionate shoulder to lean on. 

<br>
<br>
Good luck on your future endeavors!
<br>
